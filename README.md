# probing_BERT
This project explores how BERT encodes syntactic clause boundaries across its internal layers using Russian dependency-parsed data from the SynTagRus corpus. It implements cosine similarity analysis, linear probing with multiclass/binary classifiers, and UMAP visualization to identify layer-specific syntactic patterns.
